### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jeremy ðŸ‘‹

I do Ruby and Rails for more than 10 years now, spending much of my time in the backend part, thinking about domain modelling, and iterating on existing features; but I do like quite a lot working of the frontend side using Hotwire.

Currently Iâ€™m Staff engineer at Nextory to building an app ingesting content from dozens of publishers.

## Projects
I donâ€™t have any public projects that I can shared now, but itâ€™s a situation that I really wish to change someday.

## Aside
- Sometime I share the tiny bits of knowledge I have acquired over time, but my impostor syndrome make it really hard to be consistant on my blog
- I choose to keep my main blog in French to help beginners find resources in their mother language
- Iâ€™m aphantasic, which means that I donâ€™t have a mental eye, things are just a suite of words related to each others. Thatâ€™s why it is easier for me to write to explain something than drawing an image
- I truly believe in remote work and the 4-day work week, thatâ€™s my way of working for a few years now
